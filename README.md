## What is my real name?
Assuming you want to hire me, unfortunately, I do not share my real name. If you are still interested, I can work anonymously or be commissioned on a project of your choice.

## Do I hate Java?
Absolutely! The amount of boilerplate code I had to write over the years almost gave me carpal tunnel.

## Can I see some examples of your code?
Feel free to browse my Github [repositories](https://github.com/sss-ryun?tab=repositories). I made public ones to show off my skills. There are so many in private, so if you are interested, hit me up, and I will show you some of them.

## How do I contact you?
You can directly email me at [sssryun@gmail.com](mailto:sssryun@gmail.com). Please be courteous as I automatically assume you're a spammer otherwise.
